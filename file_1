Week 3
Exercise 21


NOTE: FOR FILE 1,2,3 IN HTML



CSS  Classes/Pseudo Classes, etc 

28 September 2015

Using a code editor, create three HTML files and an external CSS file ‘styles.css’.  The files should be saved in a folder called ‘week3_ex21’ in your ‘websites’ folder.

Validate all files on completion.

Theme of the site: a + b = c
e.g. hydrogen + oxygen = water, where page1 is about hydrogen, page2 about oxygen and page3 water.
(worm + hook = fish,  lead + ? = gold, milk + shake = milkshake, football + boot = goal)

You will need at least one image for each of the pages. Source the images online. 

STYLESHEET
1.	Include the following properties for the p selector; background-color, font-size, font-weight and color.

2.	h2s should have a black background with white text.

3.	Create a class – p.nb - which changes the font-family and the text colour.

4.	Create a class – p.line – which justifies text. Use the ‘text-align’ property in conjunction with the ‘’justify’ value. Justified text ensures a straight margin on both the right and left of a block of text, so you will need a number of lines of text within the paragraph to observe the effect.

5.	Create a class - .bright – which sets a background colour of yellow. 
 
6.	Set values for links
a:link
a:visited
a:hover
a:active


HTML PAGES
1.	Include <header>, <nav>, <main> and <footer> elements in all HTML files. 

2. All pages should be linked.

3. On each of the HTML pages there should be an instance of a normal <p> tag and a <p> tag using one of the classes. 

4. Each page should also use the <h2> tag.

5. One of the pages should use class3 in conjunction with a <h1> tag, and with a <p> tag.

Extra:
In at least one instance correctly demonstrate the use of an article element (<article>...</article>).
